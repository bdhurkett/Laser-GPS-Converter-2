# Laser-GPS-Converter-2

A tool to export GPX files from the program Laser GPS for various Navigator GPS devices. More details: https://bdhurkett.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/laser-gps-converter-v2-update/

I recommend using https://github.com/Thom-x/Laser-GPS-Converter-2/ instead - the fork supports Navig8r devices with heart rate monitors and has easier multiple-export functionality.
